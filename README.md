# Fit To Print

## A news app built without any libraries or frameworks to see how much functionality can be built in vanilla Javascript
## Using APIs from The Guardian and the New York Times newspapers
*Javascript - DOM Manipulation - Fetch - Async/Await - CSS*

### An overview of the homepage and the top stories page: the homepage features both newspapers' most read articles of the moment

### Can tweet any of the articles from your personal Twitter account

### The NYT API has a 'per-facet' property which lists names of people mentioned in its articles - clicking on them searches both the NYT and the Guardian for that name

### Users can search both APIs with the same keyword or name at the same time

### The gallery shows the newspapers' 20 most popular articles - clicking on one will open the article in a new tab

#### **Biggest obstacle:** the NYT API is regularly being modified... almost weekly.  This means that property names are changed and articles generate with broken links or missing images etc.  For example, they keep changing the property for accessing their article images: meta-data.image to metadata.thumbnail to metadata.image.
